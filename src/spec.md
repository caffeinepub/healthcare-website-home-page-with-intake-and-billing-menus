# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a simple healthcare web app frontend with a Home page navigation menu linking to Intake and Billing pages, using a cohesive healthcare-appropriate theme (not a blue & purple main palette) and including a static logo and hero image.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a Home page with a visible navigation menu containing exactly two items: “Intake” and “Billing”, using client-side navigation.
- Add an “Intake” route/page with header “Intake” and placeholder text indicating patient intake.
- Add a “Billing” route/page with header “Billing” and placeholder text indicating billing.
- Apply consistent, clean healthcare styling across Home/Intake/Billing (colors, typography, spacing), avoiding a blue & purple primary palette.
- Add and render generated static images from `frontend/public/assets/generated` (logo in top navigation; hero image on Home).

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open the Home page, see a healthcare-themed layout with a logo and hero image, and navigate between Intake and Billing pages without full page reloads.
