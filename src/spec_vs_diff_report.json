  "summary": "Core routing and UI pages (Home/Intake/Billing) plus a shared Header navigation with exactly two menu items are implemented, along with a cohesive teal/green theme via Tailwind CSS variables. However, the required generated static image files themselves are not evidenced as added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and several unrequested authentication/actor/react-query utilities were introduced despite being listed as non-goals.",

      "reason": "The UI references the generated image paths, but the diff summary does not show the actual image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, so existence with exact filenames cannot be verified from the provided changes.",
